                  <p>Many scholars in our country advocate that dance originated from the theory of labor, because labor is the first need for human survival and development, and labor creates people themselves.
 Labor makes people break away from the animal world, and labor creates human society. In the dance of primitive people, the greatest proportion of hunting and planting and various labor life is represented.
We believe that the above theories of the origin of dance have certain truths, but they are not very complete and comprehensive, because dance activities are a social phenomenon in human life, and its origin 
is the same as that of everything in the world. They are not single, but have many factors, so people advocate the "comprehensive theory of labor", that is, dance originates from the needs of human survival,
 development of labor practice and other kinds of life practices. It is said that dance originated from the simulation of ancient human beings in the pursuit of survival and development, such as labor production 
(hunting, farming), sex, fitness and combat drills, as well as totem worship, witchcraft religious sacrifice activities and the expression of their own emotional thoughts. Impulsive needs. It is combined with poetry
 and music and is one of the earliest forms of art in human history.
